        World Bank staff were apparently told to give preferential treatment
        to the son of a high-ranking Trump administration official
        after the US Treasury threw its support behind a $13bn (£10bn)
        funding increase for the organisation, a leaked recording suggests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The World Bank said it was unaware of any recordings,
        had no way to confirm whether they occurred,
        or whether they were accurate transcriptions of what was said.
